# Sampling Assignment

## Objective
To study the impact of different sampling techniques on machine learning model performance for an imbalanced credit card dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used is Creditcard_data.csv, which contains a highly imbalanced class distribution.

## Sampling Techniques Used
- Random Under Sampling
- Random Over Sampling
- SMOTE
- SMOTE with Tomek Links
- SMOTE with ENN

## Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Machine

## Results
Accuracy was evaluated for each model under different sampling techniques. The results show that different models perform best with different sampling strategies.

## Best Sampling Technique per Model
- Logistic Regression: SMOTE
- Decision Tree: SMOTE
- Random Forest: Random Over Sampling
- KNN: Random Over Sampling
- SVM: Random Over Sampling

## Conclusion
Sampling plays a crucial role in handling imbalanced datasets, and the choice of sampling technique significantly affects model performance.
